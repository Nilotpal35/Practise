# Practise

In this App i have tried to implement 
-> USER Authentication using Firebase Authentication featue and validating the user .
-> Get Data on Authentication
-> AsyncStorage

for that i have use some thrid party libraries also.
-> @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
-> axios 
-> expo-linear-gradient 

Later i will add Project snap Stack here for quick look up in to app.

Thanks
